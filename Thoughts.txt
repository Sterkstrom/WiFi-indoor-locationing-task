What do I want to do:

- Need to exclude all values of 100, as this does not provide much info
- I want to normalize by row, having excluded 100. (Because different phones get different values from same spot)
- 

1. Take a sample of the training set (Sample-train)
2. Predict over the cross validation set (phase 1)
3. We then predict over the testing set. The whole set minus the sample (phase 2)
4. We then go the the validation set. 
5. Predict from the validation set (Phase 3)
6. REAL production. Send the models that we want to the university (Phase 4)
